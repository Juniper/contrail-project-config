      A subset of what the 'base' job provides: the absolute minimum considered
      required to run for any one job.
      It doesn't set up cached git repositories, will not set up mirrors,
      doesn't validate the node and does not generate an ARA report.
      These tasks, if required, can be included by the dependant jobs
      themselves on a need basis.

      which copy job's git repositories prepared by zuul merger to all
      nodes that are part of the nodeset. It also runs post-playbooks
